{: .lead}
Hello there! I'm Daniel, an aspiring **software developer**, avid book reader, and cautious climber.

Ever since my memory banks decided to start recording, I've been fascinated with puzzles and <mark>problem solving</mark>, which has given me a strong desire to <mark>learn kinaesthetically</mark>.  I don't always get things right (*that's where version control comes in handy*), but as long as I'm learning along the way, I have the <mark>drive to improve</mark>.  If I'm working on a project, or attempting to solve yet another programmatic problem, you'll typically find me awake in the late, peaceful hours of the night, chasing solutions to compiler errors. 

I'm never quite inclined to be content with my knowledge base, which leads me to constantly <mark>strive to build</mark> upon it.  This tends to result in a great deal of linear <mark>progression</mark>, an example being this site itself.

Creating a site requires a little bit of knowledge in HTML, but if you want it to look appealing, you're going to want to understand and implement some CSS.  Once a basic site is in place, you'll quickly realise that not all screen sizes are created equal and learn of the term *responsive design*.  To your horror, you'll have to update your CSS and implement media queries. However, a quick, panicked search reveals the world of CSS frameworks, such as Bootstrap.  Once all that is taken care of, you may actually want to start creating some content... but you recognise the fact that all of your boilerplate and static content has to be duplicated across each and every HTML page.  You think that's quite silly, so instead, you look into loading content dynamically through the use of *jQuery*... and then understand the limitations and redo everything using a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/performance/static-site-generator/" target="_blank">static site generator</a> such as *Jekyll*.  You get the gist: solving problems creates new problems, which you ultimately benefit from in the form of knowledge.

What are my *actual* qualifications?

Currently, I am a fellow of the Correlation-One Amazon Career Choice <mark>Software Development</mark> course (due to be completed in June 2023).

After studying for 4 years (inclusive of 1 year in industrial placement), I graduated with a first-class BSc Honours degree in <mark>Computer Games Development</mark> (obtaining a distinction in placement) from the University of Central Lancashire.

Activities I get up to in my spare time

<mark>Paragliding</mark> is without a doubt my favourite hobby.  There's something surreal and cathartic about launching yourself off a hill and gracefully soaring above the landscape below, before gently landing in an open field.  Unfortunately, it's also incredibly weather dependent, and living in the UK, well... it's not ideal.  Due to this, I took up <mark>climbing</mark>, both (majoritively) indoor, and outdoor.  I instantly fell in love with climbing (top rope and bouldering), as you're able to have fun while you're getting a workout, as well as quickly and noticeably progress your technique.  The dopamine levels are at an all time high when you climb a project that has a grade you believed was just out of reach.

Hardly keeping idle, I also enjoy the classics of <mark>hiking</mark>, <mark>running</mark>, and - *slightly more niche* - <mark>badminton</mark>.  I'm thankful to have the privilege of living in close proximity to the Peak District, where I've frequently hiked around Hathersage (Stanage Edge), the Great Ridge (Mam Tor to Lose Hill) and Kinder Scout.  A little further afield, I've been astounded by the beauty of both Snowdonia, and the Lake District.  The bucket list item of completing the Three Peaks Challenge remains unchecked; I'll check it off one day!

Finally, like many people who found themselves stuck at home with bags of time during the COVID-19 pandemic, I sought a creative outlet.  After having never properly played an instrument in my life, I decided to learn to play the <mark>piano</mark>.  Months of hard graft later, I finally got my stupid fingers to play some melodies and my stupid hands to work independently of one another.  I eventually achieved a full playthrough of the song 'Comptine d'un autre été' from the film 'Amélie'.
